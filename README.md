# file-to-midi-converter
Converts files to MIDI format and back.

To convert a file to a MIDI file or back:
```
python3 main.py <filename>
```

If <filename> is anything but a .mid file, it will convert it to a MIDI file. If <filename> is a .mid file it will convert it back to the original file type.
